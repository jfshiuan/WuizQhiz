            <div class="helpSection">About:</div> QuizWhiz is an app intended to supplement student learning by testing the studentâ€™s knowledge in their current classes by having them compete against fellow students in an engaging trivia game. These topics are personalized to cater to students learning goals through collaboration with their instructors who are actively creating new quiz sets that allow the students to better understand the materials covered in their classes.

            <div class="helpSection">Signing Up:</div> New users must create an account by clicking the signup button on the starting screen. The user will then have the option to choose between creating a student account or an instructor account.
            Student account: The student account allows the user to play against other students taking the same classes in a one-on-one trivia game. Each student account has access to a list of available classes, a personalized friends list, leaderboards, and personal stats to track their performance and improvements.
